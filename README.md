# Analysis of Hospital Bed Availability and Education in Connection Covid Deaths (In PA and OH Counties) 
Project 1 for ChE 2410

Obtaining knowledge of disease and illness spread is an important concern of modern science. We often seek to identify the potential factors that promote or inhibit the spread of illness amongst populations. Moreover, we often attempt to identify characteristics amongst the population itself that affect the spread of illness. In wake of the Covid-19 pandemic significant research has been devoted to understanding the contributing factors to its spread in the context of population influences. Futhermore, research seeks to rationalize any differences in Covid-19 fatalities amongst various counties.
