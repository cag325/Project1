# Analysis of Hospital Presence and Education in Connection Covid Deaths (In PA and OH Counties) 
Project 1 for ChE 2410

Obtaining knowledge of disease and illness spread is an important concern of modern science. We often seek to identify the potential factors that promote or inhibit the spread of illness amongst populations. Moreover, we often attempt to identify characteristics amongst the population itself that affect the spread of illness. In wake of the Covid-19 pandemic significant research has been devoted to understanding the contributing factors to its spread in the context of population influences. Futhermore, current research seeks to rationalize any differences in Covid-19 fatalities amongst various counties. 

The purpose of this research was to analyze if education or hospital presence contributed to differences in Covid outcomes between  Pennsylvania (PA) and Ohio (OH) counties.The motivation behind this research is not revolutionary but rather seeks to understand if any fundamental characteristics of a population contribute to differences in Covid outcomes. One would likely assume that counties with a higher population of college educated individuals would possess a greater level of basic knowledge of disease spread mitigation practices and health practices in general or be capable of informing themselves through scientific literature. Such knowledge would lead one to suspect their outcomes following Covid-19 infection would be better than those who are less educated. Similarly, one would also likely assume that counties with a greater hospital presence would enable more patients to recieve medical care following Covid-19 infection and subsequently contribute to a better outcome than counties with less or no hospital presence. These assumptions therefore need to be evaluated on scientifically rigours standard to test their validity.
